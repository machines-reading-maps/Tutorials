# Tutorials and Newsletters

In this repo the MRM team is going to make available the tutorials to the tools developed within the project, and all the communications for the advisory board. The turorials will be produced in various formats, and in different versions for different kind of users. The communications with the advisory board will mostly be available as PDF files.
