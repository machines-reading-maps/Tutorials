Fort or Ring In the townland of Ballynahatty there is a giant's ring. It is nearly neally circular, the diameter of which is about 222 yards. It is on the top of a hill and has an artificial mound about 16 feet high and as many broad at the base. The hill upon which it stands is about 180 feet above the level of the sea. In the centre of the ring there is a cromlech (which is not remarkable). If at any time this place served as a place of defence, the selection of the spot showed judgement, as the natural hill immediately to the east and south of the ring is extremely steep; the north and west side is protected by the River Lagan.

Meeting Houses Townland Ballycarn, dimensions 60 feet by 40, would contain 400 persons. Erected about 1830, expenses paid by the parish and public contributions. The funds not being sufficient to defray the expenses incurred, some debts remain unpaid. It is a fine meeting house of the plainest architecture and situated in the centre of a small plantation ^p5. Townland of Drumbo, is very much out of repair, especially the interior, erected in 1750. 65 seats in the aisle and 54 in gallery would contain 7 persons each, dimensions: [ground plan, dimensions 72 by 50 feet, "T" shape]. This meeting house would accommodate all the Presbyterians of the parish and might have been perfectly repaired for the one-sixth of the sum exhausted in the erection and completion of the new meeting house in the adjoining townland. It would appear that there was some new regulation respecting the appointment of ministers for the Presbyterian Church, as a congregation, when they do not like their minister, enter into a subscription and cause the erection of another house. Thus the congregation is divided, and it is frequently the case that both parties find (too late) their inability to meet the expenses of keeping in repair their respective houses.

Rivers The River Lagan bounds it on its north western side but it is only navigable in parts, a canal having been cut along it at different distances where the river does not afford sufficient depths. Barges with coals and rafts of timber pass up it to Lisburn. There is a bridge over it called Shaws bridge which crosses it in the townland of Ballynavally. Its banks are flat and cultivated and in some parts planted with trees. The current is very slow and its bottom muddy.

Round Tower At the village of Drumbo in the townland of that name is the ruin of one of the round towers. Its present height is 34 feet. It is built of rough greywacke stone. On one side, the entrance on the right going in, is a piece of white sandstone, the only piece I could discover. There is an entrance on its southern side i.e. an opening at about 5 feet from the ground. This opening is about 3 feet in height and 1 foot broad, and the bottom of the tower, that is the ground inside, is 1 foot below the sill of the entrance. In the interior there are holes in the wall commencing at about 5 feet from the bottom and continuing above each other in 3 lines about 5 feet distant from each other. They are irregularly placed with respect to their distance from each other laterally, but are always on the same level. There is ^p3 a small opening on its eastern side about 2 feet below its present top. The ground on which it is situated is used as a burying ground (see sketch).
